# Specification Created

## PROMPT_TEXT
Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Target audience:
_ AI students and developers advancing into robot perception and autonomy
_ Focus on perception, training, and navigation intelligence

Chapters (Docusaurus):
1. NVIDIA Isaac Sim
   _ Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation

2. Isaac ROS
   _ Hardware-accelerated VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and navigation

3. Nav2 for Humanoid Movement
   _ Path planning for bipedal humanoid robots

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Created comprehensive specification for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™), including three prioritized user stories (P1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation, P2: Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM, P3: Nav2 for humanoid movement path planning). Defined functional requirements, success criteria with measurable outcomes, and edge cases. Created quality checklist to validate the specification. The spec is ready for planning phase.

## OUTCOME
Successfully created a complete feature specification for NVIDIA Isaac-based AI robotics content covering perception, navigation, and synthetic data generation for AI students and developers.

## EVALUATION
The specification is comprehensive, with clear user stories, measurable success criteria, and well-defined requirements. It follows the template structure and is ready for the planning phase.
