# Implementation Planning Completed

## PROMPT_TEXT
Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

- Set up Module-3 in Docusaurus with structed chapters.
- Create 3 chapters as .md files:
  1. NVIDIA Isaac sim for photorealistic simulation
  2. Isaac ROS for VSLAM and navigation
  3. Nav2 path planning for humanoid robots

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Completed comprehensive implementation planning for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac). Created detailed plan.md with technical context, constitution check, and phased implementation strategy. Researched Isaac Sim installation, Isaac ROS VSLAM packages, and Nav2 humanoid parameters in research.md. Defined content data model in data-model.md. Created quickstart guide for users. Developed API contracts for documentation system. All constitution principles verified and gates passed.

## OUTCOME
Successfully created complete implementation plan for NVIDIA Isaac-based AI robotics module with all required artifacts and research findings.

## EVALUATION
The planning phase is complete with all required artifacts created. The plan aligns with the feature specification and follows constitution principles. Ready to proceed to task generation phase.
