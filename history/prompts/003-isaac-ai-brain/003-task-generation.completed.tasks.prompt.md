# Task Generation Completed

## PROMPT_TEXT
$ARGUMENTS

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Generated comprehensive task list for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) with 58 specific tasks across 6 phases. Created tasks for User Story 1 (Isaac Sim - 11 tasks), User Story 2 (Isaac ROS - 11 tasks), and User Story 3 (Nav2 for Humanoid - 11 tasks). Included setup tasks (6), foundational tasks (6), and polish tasks (14). Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels, and file paths. Tasks organized by priority and dependencies to enable independent implementation and testing.

## OUTCOME
Successfully created a complete, executable task list for implementing the NVIDIA Isaac AI robotics module with all required phases and dependencies.

## EVALUATION
The task generation is complete with all required phases, properly formatted tasks, and clear dependencies. Ready for implementation phase.
