# Specification Created

## PROMPT_TEXT
Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Target audience:
_ AI students and developers exploring the convergence of LLMs and robotics
_ Learners focusing on multimodal intelligence and autonomous behavior

Chapters (Docusaurus):
1. Voice-to-Action
   _ Using OpenAI Whisper for voice command understanding

2. Cognitive Planning with LLMs
   _ Translating natural language commands (e.g., "Clean the room") into ROS 2 action sequences

3. Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid
   _ A simulated humanoid that receives a voice command, plans a path, navigates obstacles, identifies objects using computer vision, and manipulates them

## RESPONSE_TEXT
Created comprehensive specification for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA), including three prioritized user stories (P1: Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper, P2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs, P3: Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid). Defined functional requirements, success criteria with measurable outcomes, and edge cases. Created quality checklist to validate the specification. The spec is ready for planning phase.

## OUTCOME
Successfully created a complete feature specification for Vision-Language-Action integration covering voice recognition, LLM-based planning, and autonomous humanoid implementation for AI students and developers.

## EVALUATION
The specification is comprehensive, with clear user stories, measurable success criteria, and well-defined requirements. It follows the template structure and is ready for the planning phase.
