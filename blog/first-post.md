# Welcome to Our Blog

Welcome to the official blog of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics project! This blog will serve as a platform for sharing insights, updates, and technical discussions about humanoid robotics and the development of our AI-authored textbook.

## About Our Project

We are developing a comprehensive textbook for humanoid robotics with an embedded RAG chatbot to answer questions about the content. Our focus is on practical implementation and real-world applications of humanoid robotics technology.

## What to Expect

In future posts, we'll cover topics such as:

- Advanced ROS 2 concepts for humanoid robots
- Control systems and kinematics
- Perception and AI integration
- Real-world case studies
- Technical tutorials and best practices

Stay tuned for more exciting content!
